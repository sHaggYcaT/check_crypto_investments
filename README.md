# This script can help you to check your crypto investments.

## Requirements

This is python3 script. So, you should have python3 in your system.
The script wrote and tested in Linux box. If it fail in Windows or
OS X computers, please send me bug report.

You should have in your system or virtualenv for this script
these modules:

If you haven't something, you can install it using pip, for example:

` pip install coinmarketcap `

You should use currency.ini file. Please fill in it whatever coins or tockens you want.
You can find an example in the github.
Actually, script supports only USD as fiat currency. In the future I'll implement other
currencies
